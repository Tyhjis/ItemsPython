# ItemsPython

### A Django application for storing information about stuff in general.

This application is a web-based database which I (as of May 2016 "will") use to list my personal belongings. This is more like a personal django/python exercise.

### About the database

The database will be small and simple. At this moment django is configured to use the basic sqlite3 database, but will be changed to either postgresql or mysql in the future. (At least when the app is in "production".)
